The Bitmap Test Suite 0.9
-------------------------

The Bitmap Test Suite provides a set of Windows bitmap files
that yield near-complete code coverage of bitmap processing software.
It includes a sampling of various well-formed bitmap encodings,
as well as an extensive set of malformed bitmap files.

It includes bitmaps of all legal bit depths, both uncompressed RGB 
and RLE compressed bitmaps, and various widths (to test padding).

It also includes an extensive set of unconventional, malformed,
and even malicious bitmaps.

At this time, it does NOT include any JPEG or PNG compressed bitmaps.
The full set of missing test cases are described in the TODO file.

Organization
============
The bitmaps are put into three directories: valid, questionable, and
corrupt.

The "valid" directory contains bitmap files that all conforming bitmap
processors should be able to process.

The "questionable" directory contains bitmap files that malformed in
some non-critical way.
A conforming bitmap processor may reject any of these bitmaps but 
most will ignore the error and process them anyway.

The "corrupt" directory contains bitmap files that are seriously
malformed, possibly even malicious.
A conforming bitmap processor may reject any of these files, 
but should not crash or leak memory when asked to process any of them.
A superior bitmap processor will display an informative, accurate
diagnostic for each file that it cannot process.


Web Resources
=============
The project status, as well as the latest version of the bitmap test
suite, is available online at SourceForge:

Copyrights
==========
The Bitmap Test Suite has been dedicated into the public domain.
I did this (instead of licensing it under the BSD or GPL) because I
didn't want any legal concerns to inhibit the testing of software.
